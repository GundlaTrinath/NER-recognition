On May 13, the CDC issued a statement that fully vaccinated individuals can safely do most activities without wearing a mask or the need to social distance from others. The decision was prompted by a drop in virus cases and the huge availability of three Covid-19 vaccines -- Moderna, PfizerBioNTech and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen.

However, the US is once again seeing a rise in Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. As of July 22, 35 per cent of US counties are experiencing high levels of community transmission. Covid-19 cases are on the rise in nearly 90 per cent of US jurisdictions, with outbreaks recorded in parts with low vaccination coverage.

The CDC says the recent hike in cases is due to the rapid spread of the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 or Delta variant, which was first reported in India.

Despite a rise in cases, the CDC has not revised its masking guidelines. However, several states in the US have issued separate guidelines for their residents, making wearing of masks in public or indoors mandatory.
